# Rosalind Bionformatics Solution
[Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/) is a platform for learning bioinformatics and programming through problem solving.


## A repo for Rosalind solutions in NodeJS (JavaScript) and Python3
The following problems were attempted:

  - [DNA](https://rosalind.info/problems/dna/)	Counting DNA Nucleotides
  - [RNA](https://rosalind.info/problems/rna/)	Transcribing DNA into RNA	
  - [REVC](https://rosalind.info/problems/revc/)	Complementing a Strand of DNA
  - [FIB](https://rosalind.info/problems/fib/)	Rabbits and Recurrence Relations
  - [GC](https://rosalind.info/problems/gc/)	Computing GC Content
  - [HAMM](https://rosalind.info/problems/hamm/)	Counting Point Mutations
  - [PROT](https://rosalind.info/problems/prot/)	Translating RNA into Protein
  - [SUBS](https://rosalind.info/problems/subs/)	Finding a Motif in DNA
  - [FIBD](https://rosalind.info/problems/fibd/)	Mortal Fibonacci Rabbits
  - [MPRT](https://rosalind.info/problems/mprt/)	Finding a Protein Motif

**Some problems** have a draft. Which is the code without good formatting and explanations and comments.
